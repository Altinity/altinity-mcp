# OAuth refresh-token reuse detection (H-2)

This page documents the H-2 mitigation from the internal OAuth security
review: how it works, what operators must do before turning it on, and how
it fails. It is opt-in — set `oauth.refresh_revokes_tracking: true` only
after running the operator prerequisites below.

## Why this exists

Without H-2, gating-mode refresh tokens are stateless JWE blobs. A captured
refresh token can be redeemed many times — each redemption mints a fresh
`access_token` + rotated `refresh_token` pair until the original JWE expires
(default 30 days). An attacker who briefly captures a refresh JWE (leaked
log, intermediate proxy, browser-extension compromise) gets a silent 30-day
window of access against the legitimate user's identity.

OAuth 2.1 §4.13.2 and the MCP authorization spec (2025-11-25) require
*refresh-token rotation with reuse detection*: when a previously-redeemed
token is presented again, the entire token *family* must be invalidated and
the user forced to re-authenticate. RFC 6749 §10.4 frames the same
requirement at SHOULD level for OAuth 2.0.

H-2 closes the gap: the moment the legitimate client refreshes after the
attacker (or vice-versa), the redeemed jti is in the consumed-set, the
family is revoked, both parties are rejected on subsequent attempts, and
the user re-authenticates once. The auth event is a clear signal.

## How it works

Every gating-mode refresh JWE carries two new claims:

| Claim       | Lifecycle                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jti`       | Fresh 16-byte random hex per issuance. **Different every refresh.** |
| `family_id` | Fresh 16-byte random hex at code→token exchange. **Stable across the entire rotation chain.** |

```
client → POST /oauth/token grant_type=authorization_code
server → mint R1 { jti: A, family_id: F, ... }              [F is new]

client → POST /oauth/token grant_type=refresh_token, R1
server → check: A not in consumed, F not in revoked
       → INSERT (jti=A, family_id=F) into consumed
       → mint R2 { jti: B, family_id: F, ... }              [same F, new jti]

client → POST /oauth/token grant_type=refresh_token, R2
server → check: B not in consumed, F not in revoked
       → INSERT (jti=B, family_id=F) into consumed
       → mint R3 { jti: C, family_id: F, ... }
```

Reuse detection:

```
attacker steals R1 before client uses it.
client legitimately refreshes R1 → R2 (A consumed, F still healthy)
client refreshes R2 → R3 (B consumed)
attacker now presents R1: server sees A already in consumed
                        → INSERT (family_id=F, reason="reuse_detected") into revoked_families
                        → reject this request with invalid_grant
                        → next legit refresh of R3 sees F in revoked → also rejected
                        → user re-auths from scratch
```

State lives in two ClickHouse tables in the `altinity` database. **Both
are KeeperMap** so reads and writes are linearizable through Keeper Raft —
there is no replication-lag window where a pod talking to one CH replica
fails to see another pod's recent write.

| Table                                        | Engine                  | Strict mode | Cleanup                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `altinity.oauth_refresh_consumed_jtis`       | KeeperMap               | yes (per-INSERT) — duplicate jti throws `KEEPER_EXCEPTION` | in-process `ALTER TABLE … DELETE` goroutine, hourly, 35-day retention |
| `altinity.oauth_refresh_revoked_families`    | KeeperMap               | no — duplicate family_id idempotently overwrites (parallel revokes are fine) | same goroutine, same retention |

Each refresh = 1 cheap `SELECT count() FROM revoked_families` (point lookup
by family_id) + 1 atomic `INSERT … SETTINGS keeper_map_strict_mode = 1`
into consumed_jtis. At realistic load (~hundreds of clients refreshing
~once per hour) that's on the order of 0.5 qps cluster-wide. Negligible.

### Why KeeperMap (for both tables) and not ReplicatedMergeTree

The earlier H-2 design used `SELECT count() WHERE jti = ?` followed by
`INSERT` into a `ReplicatedMergeTree` consumed-jtis table. That pattern
is **not race-safe**: two parallel redemptions of the same captured
refresh JWE both observe `count() = 0` on the SELECT, both succeed at
the INSERT, and the family forks before any reuse is detected. From
that point an attacker who steals a single token has their own valid
branch of the family chain and never needs the original token again.

KeeperMap with `keeper_map_strict_mode=1` is the fix for the consumed-
jti claim. It's a key-value table engine backed by ClickHouse Keeper's
Raft consensus. Concurrent INSERTs of the same primary key are
serialised through the Keeper leader; exactly one wins, the rest
receive `KEEPER_EXCEPTION: Transaction failed (Node exists)` (Code 999).
The MCP store detects this signature and proceeds to record the family
revocation. RFC 9700 §refresh-token rotation: the server cannot tell
which of two concurrent redeemers is legitimate, so the family dies on
detection.

The `revoked_families` table is **also** KeeperMap, for a parallel
reason. Without linearizable reads on revocation state, the refresh
path's pre-check `SELECT count() FROM revoked_families WHERE
family_id = F` could miss a recent revoke on a CH replica that hasn't
yet seen the loser's INSERT. The winner of a forked family could then
keep refreshing its branch on different MCP pods/replicas while
replication catches up — exactly the window the design is supposed to
close. With both tables on Keeper, every refresh sees the
authoritative state.

KeeperMap doesn't add a Keeper dependency — `ReplicatedMergeTree` is
already on Keeper for replication coordination. KeeperMap simply
exposes the linearizable primitive Keeper already provides.

### Revoke must persist (not best-effort)

When the consumed-jti INSERT fails with the duplicate-key exception,
the handler attempts to record the family revocation. If THAT INSERT
also fails (Keeper unavailable, etc.), the handler does NOT fall back
to a "best-effort" rejection. The previous design logged a WARN and
returned `ErrRefreshReused` regardless; that left the winner's branch
of the forked family alive for every subsequent refresh against any
MCP pod, because no row landed in `revoked_families`. The current
code promotes a failed revoke INSERT to a **hard error** (HTTP 500
`server_error`); operators page on the ERR log line, the underlying
Keeper or grant issue gets fixed, and the next attempt to redeem the
same R0 hits the same code path and writes the revoke for real.

### Post-claim revocation re-check

The pre-check in step (1) of `CheckAndConsume` and the atomic claim in
step (2) are not a single Keeper transaction. There's a microsecond
window between them where another pod could revoke the family. The
store closes this TOCTOU by re-checking revocation **after** the claim
succeeds. If revocation arrived during the window, the response is
`ErrRefreshReused` (HTTP 400 invalid_grant); the consumed-jti slot is
spent but no token is minted. The family stays revoked, all subsequent
refreshes fail at step (1), the user re-auths.

### `keeper_map_strict_mode` is per-query

ClickHouse silently ignores `SETTINGS keeper_map_strict_mode = 1` when
declared at table-create time — only the per-query setting is honoured.
The MCP binary applies it on every consumed-jti INSERT:

```sql
INSERT INTO altinity.oauth_refresh_consumed_jtis (jti, family_id)
SETTINGS keeper_map_strict_mode = 1
VALUES (?, ?)
```

If a future refactor drops the `SETTINGS` clause, duplicate INSERTs
silently overwrite the existing row instead of erroring, and the
atomicity property collapses. The clause is load-bearing.

## Operator prerequisites

Two steps, both as a CH admin user, **before** flipping the flag in helm
values:

### 1. Enable KeeperMap (one-time per CH cluster)

KeeperMap requires `<keeper_map_path_prefix>` in the CH server config.
Without it, `CREATE TABLE … ENGINE = KeeperMap` fails with
`Code: 36. KeeperMap is disabled because 'keeper_map_path_prefix' config
is not defined`.

Add a `config.d` drop-in:

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <keeper_map_path_prefix>/altinity_mcp/keeper_map</keeper_map_path_prefix>
</clickhouse>
```

For ACM-managed CHIs the setting name is `config.d/keeper_map.xml` —
`acmctl raw POST /cluster/<id>/settings` (with name+value+description as
JSON body via stdin) followed by `acmctl raw POST /cluster/<id>/push`.
The CH pod restarts automatically after push (~30–60 s).

Verify:

```sql
CREATE TABLE default.kmap_smoke (k String) ENGINE = KeeperMap('/altinity_mcp/smoke') PRIMARY KEY k;
DROP TABLE default.kmap_smoke;
```

Both should succeed.

### 2. Run the DDL

[`docs/sql/oauth-state.sql`](sql/oauth-state.sql) creates the `altinity`
database, both tables, and grants `INSERT, SELECT, ALTER DELETE ON
altinity.* TO mcp_service`.

The MCP binary is engine-aware: KeeperMap for consumed_jtis,
ReplicatedMergeTree for revoked_families. Mixing engines is intentional
(see "Why KeeperMap and not just ReplicatedMergeTree" above).

### Cluster name: `all-replicated` and why

The DDL uses `ON CLUSTER 'all-replicated'` rather than the operator-default
`{cluster}` macro. Reason: the primary cluster may be sharded across
multiple physical clusters. OAuth state must live in a single logical shard
so every MCP pod sees a consistent view of consumed jtis. By convention,
`all-replicated` names a single shard spanning all replicas — operators
configure this in the CHI's `<remote_servers>` block.

If your CHI uses a different name for the all-replicas-single-shard
cluster, edit `docs/sql/oauth-state.sql` to match. The Go code does not
care about the cluster name; it only ever issues SELECT and INSERT.

### `mcp_service` user and the `read_only` constraint

The pool user (typically `mcp_service`) needs `INSERT, SELECT, ALTER
DELETE ON altinity.*`. The DDL adds the grant.

`ALTER DELETE` is needed because KeeperMap doesn't support CH-native
TTL — the MCP binary runs `ALTER TABLE altinity.oauth_refresh_consumed_jtis
DELETE WHERE consumed_at < now() - INTERVAL 35 DAY` from an in-process
goroutine on an hourly ticker (see `pkg/oauth_state/cleanup.go`). Multi-pod
deployments all run their own loops; duplicate `ALTER DELETE`s are
harmless.

**Important**: when `oauth.refresh_revokes_tracking: true`, the pool user
**cannot** be read-only. Two checkpoints:

1. **MCP-side**: `cfg.ClickHouse.read_only` must be `false`. Startup
   validation refuses to boot if it's `true` while the flag is on.
2. **CH-side**: the user's settings profile cannot include `readonly = 1`
   (or `2`). The operator is responsible for this — there is no way for
   MCP to inspect a profile from the client side without trying a write.
   Verify:

   ```sql
   SELECT name, profile FROM system.users WHERE name = 'mcp_service';
   SELECT name, value FROM system.settings_profiles
   WHERE name IN (SELECT profile FROM system.users WHERE name = 'mcp_service');
   ```

   No row should set `readonly` to a non-zero value.

If the pool user *is* read-only, the first refresh after enabling the flag
will hard-fail with `server_error` and an ERR-level zerolog line. Roll
back by flipping the flag to `false`; the refresh path returns to its
stateless behavior.

## Failure modes — hard fail with ERR

Every CH-state failure path returns HTTP 500 `server_error` and emits an
ERR-level zerolog line. We never silently fall through to "mint a new
pair anyway" — that would defeat the security control.

| Cleanup `ALTER DELETE` fails                   | (no user impact)           | WARN `oauth_state cleanup attempt failed (non-fatal)` |

## Legacy-token policy

Refresh tokens issued before the flag flips lack the `jti` and `family_id`
claims. They are rejected with `invalid_grant` on first redemption after
deploy. Clients re-authenticate once.

The alternative — auto-promote legacy tokens on first use — would let a
captured pre-deploy token be replayed exactly once before the server
starts tracking the family. We rejected that approach: a brief re-login
is cheaper than a silent bypass window.

## Rollback

Set `oauth.refresh_revokes_tracking: false` in helm values, helm-upgrade.
The refresh path returns to its current stateless behavior — no DB hit, no
family-id propagation. In-flight refresh tokens that already carry the
`jti`/`family_id` claims continue to work; the JWE whitelist accepts them
even when the flag is off.

The state tables can stay populated; TTL drops them in 35 days. There's
no harm in leaving them — re-enabling the flag later picks up a clean
table state plus whatever consumed jtis from the last 35 days are still
relevant (most aren't, since each token's lifetime is 30 days).
